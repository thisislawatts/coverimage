[![Scrutinizer Code Quality](https://scrutinizer-ci.com/g/thisislawatts/coverimage/badges/quality-score.png?b=master)](https://scrutinizer-ci.com/g/thisislawatts/coverimage/?branch=master)

Takes an element and uses the first image found to replicate the behaviour of `background-size: cover` from CSS.

The advantage of this method is that you get all the semantics/accessibility of an image present within the mark-up.

Usage
---

```html
 <div data-cover-image>
   <img src="http://example.com/cat.jpg"/>
 </div>
 <script src="https://unpkg.com/coverimage/dist/coverimage.js"></script>
```

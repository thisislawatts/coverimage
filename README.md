# jQuery - Cover Dimensions

Will take an element and find an image within then size to replicate the behaviour of `background-size: cover` from CSS. The advantage of this method is that you get all the semantics/accessibility of an image.

```
 <div data-cover-image>
   <img src="http://example.com"/>
 </div>
```
